Filter out measures with samples or denominators that are too small (sample > 50, denominator > 100) based on different tests of size and accuracy.
Separate data tables based on measures that should be minimized or maximized.
Rank each hospital compared to all others in each measure.
Create a combined data table, group by hospital, and aggregate on average rank over all measures.

Scores for each measure seem to be scaled differently. Therefore, it seems to make sense to either normalize scores or rank each hospital relative to all
others in each measure. We are going to rank the hospitals within each measure. This way, on aggregate, we get a sense of the consistency of how good a hospital
is relative to all others.

Interestingly, 3 hospitals in Aurora, CO are listed in the top 10. More exploration might be necessary to find out why, but an initial glance
shows that these hospitals are run by Aurora Health Care system which likely passes on best practices and training to its facilities.

An investigation of the [data dictionary](/DDB_Data_Dictionary.pdf), specifically with regards to our effective_care data table, indicates that some
measures should be minimized (e.g. ED-1b average time patients spent in the emergency department, PC-01 percent of mothers whose deliveries were scheduled
too early when unnecessary) while other measures clearly should be maximized to account for "high quality" care (e.g. OP-29 percentage of patients
receiving appropriate recommendation for follow-up screening colonoscopy). We do not have similar problems in our readmissions data table where all
measures should  be minimized (with some attention paid to the denominator/sample).
See the investigations README for more granularity.
