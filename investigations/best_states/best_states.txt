Given that we saw 3 hospitals in Aurora, CO listed in the best_hospitals, we should expect to see CO listed somewhere in best states. Indeed, CO shows up
at #10 on the list. It is likely that other hospitals in CO brought down the performance of the few very good hospitals in CO, but not enough to bring it
out of the rankings entirely.

An investigation of the data dictionary, specifically with regards to our effective_care data table, indicates that
some measures should be minimized (e.g. ED-1b average time patients spent in the emergency department, PC-01 percent of mothers whose deliveries
were scheduled too early when unnecessary, and death rate  ) while other measures clearly should be maximized to account for "high quality"
care (e.g. OP-29 percentage of patients receiving appropriate recommendation for follow-up screening colonoscopy). We do not have similar
problems in our readmissions data table where all measures should effectively be minimized (with some attention paid to the denominator/sample).
See the investigations README for more granularity.
