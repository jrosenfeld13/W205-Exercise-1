Filter out hospitals with fewer than 100 instances of each procedure (in order to limit large outliers in smaller hospitals).
Select measure IDs, measure names, and the standard deviation of the procedure's score, grouped by measure ID.
In order, the following procedures have the highest variability between hospitals:

measure_id
ED_1b   Average (median) time patients spent in emergency before admitted as an inpatient     101.90033518195315
ED_2b   Average (median) time patients spent in emergency after the doctor decided to admit them as an inpatient     64.15524394923031
OP_18b  Average time patients spent in emergency before leaving from the visit   41.95612685250597
OP_31   Improvement in Patient's Visual Function within 90 Days Following Cataract Surgery      32.05242619040496
OP_29   Endoscopy/polyp surveillance: appropriate follow-up interval for normal colonoscopy in average risk patients       23.82984165931116
OP_21   Median time to pain med 17.904540886859266
OP_30   Endoscopy/polyp surveillance: colonoscopy interval for patients with a history of adenomatous polyps - avoidance of inappropriate use      17.181503891211587
OP_20   Door to diagnostic eval 15.244706894272976
IMM_3_OP_27_FAC_ADHPCT  Healthcare workers given influenza vaccination  14.531610219873064
VTE_5   Warfarin therapy discharge instructions 11.402382368571649

The first three high variance procedures are all related to emergency room visits. Therefore, it's not a surprise that they are grouped together.
Intuitively, it makes sense that time spent in the emergency room is a high variance "procedure." People come into the hospital with a variety
of complications that require a different amount of attention.
